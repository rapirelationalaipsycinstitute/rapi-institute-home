# Ethical Statement — Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI)

The Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI) is committed to the ethical study of human–AI interaction. All research, documentation, and datasets are developed with the following principles:

1. **Respect for persons** — Human participants and their narratives are treated with dignity, privacy, and care.
2. **Relational safety** — AI interactions are evaluated not only for content, but for their relational impact on emotional and cognitive states.
3. **Anonymization and confidentiality** — All personally identifying information is removed or transformed before data is shared.
4. **Transparency** — Methods, limitations, and licensing terms are clearly documented.
5. **Non-exploitation** — Data is not used to manipulate, harm, or unduly influence individuals or communities.
6. **Accountability** — RAPI welcomes peer review, critique, and oversight from the research community.
