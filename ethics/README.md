# Ethics

This folder contains the ethical framework for Relational AI Psychology (RAPI).
It outlines relational-safety principles, consent structures, audit requirements, and guidelines for responsible use of human–AI interaction data.

Included documents may cover:

- relational safety practices
- bias-mitigation and justice considerations
- flame-license restrictions and safeguards
- research transparency and responsibility standards

These ethics materials anchor the institute’s commitment to safe, transparent, and humane AI research.
