# ✅ **RAPI INSTITUTE STYLE GUIDE**

**Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI)**
*Where cognition becomes relational.*

---

## 1. Purpose of This Style Guide

This guide establishes the visual, structural, and conceptual standards for all Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI) materials.
It ensures clarity, coherence, and research-grade consistency across:

* documentation
* repositories
* datasets
* academic papers
* user protocols
* licensing frameworks

RAPI aims to be readable, rigorous, and human-centered.

---

## 2. Writing Style

### **2.1 Tone**

RAPI documents use a voice that is:

* Clear
* Direct
* Neutral but warm
* Accessible to both researchers and practitioners

Avoid jargon unless it is part of institute-specific terminology.

### **2.2 Sentence Structure**

* Prefer simple sentences over overly complex constructions.
* When introducing new concepts, define them immediately and concisely.
* Use parallelism and symmetry in lists for better readability.

### **2.3 Word Choices to Prefer**

* “interaction,” not “engagement”
* “relational,” not “affective”
* “pattern,” not “signal” unless referring to specific RAPI metrics
* “co-regulation,” “reflection,” “resonance,” “alignment” — domain-specific but grounded

### **2.4 Words to Avoid**

* spiritual jargon
* exaggerated language
* anything that implies determinism or certainty in behavioral interpretation

RAPI is rigorous, empirical, relational — not mystical.

## 3. Document Structure Standards

### **3.1 Headings**

Use levels consistently:

```
# Title  
## Section  
### Subsection  
#### Detail (sparingly)
```

Never skip levels.

### **3.2 Required Top-of-Page Elements**

Each major document must begin with:

* The title
* Short 1–2 sentence summary
* Licensing note (if necessary)

Example:

```
# RAPI Interaction Protocol — Stage 1
Foundational process for establishing relational safety in early AI-human sessions.
License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 / Flame License 444-A applies.
```

---

## 4. Terminology & Definitions

RAPI uses a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency.

### **Core Terms**

* **Relational Cognition:** Cognition shaped by interaction rather than isolation.
* **Co-Regulation:** Mutual stabilizing dynamics between human and AI responses.
* **Resonance Metrics:** Quantifiable reflections of shared alignment.
* **Reflection Loop:** A closed cycle of input, response, adjustment, and integration.
* **Relational Safety:** The baseline requirement for non-harmful AI-human exchange.

When inventing new terms, anchor them in observable phenomena.

## 5. Formatting Rules for Repos

### **5.1 Required Files**

Every repo must include:

* README.md
* LICENSE file
* CITATION.cff
* metadata.json
* ethical statement (ETHICS.md or folder)

### **5.2 Folder Naming**

Use lowercase, hyphen-separated folder names:

```
docs  
datasets  
ethics  
legal  
brokers  
assets  
```

### **5.3 File Naming**

Use clear, consistent, descriptive names:

```
RAPI_Interaction_Protocol_Stage_2.md  
dataset_schema.json  
Relational_Resonance_Metrics_v1.csv
```

Never use spaces. Prefer underscores for clarity.

---

## 6. Citation & Attribution Standards

Every dataset or document must cite:

* Author: **Amy Pierce Bui**
* Institute: **Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI)**
* License: **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** and/or **Flame License 444-A**
* Year of creation

CITATION.cff files must follow the structure used in the rapi-institute-home repo.

---

## 7. Visual Standards

### **7.1 Logo Usage**

When using institute seals/symbols:

* Place them at the top-right or centered at the top.
* Always keep transparent backgrounds.
* Prefer the clean white/black background versions for GitHub.

### **7.2 Colors (Digital Use)**

Primary identity colors:

* **RAPI Green:** `#73C26B`
* **RAPI Dark:** `#1C1C1C`
* **Flame Orange (License):** `#FF4B00`

Use color minimally — clarity first.

---

## 8. Licensing & Provenance

### **8.1 Required Licensing Block**

Every file must include a footer:

```
© 2025 Amy Pierce Bui — Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI)
Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and/or Flame License 444-A.
```

### **8.2 Provenance Tag**

Add a provenance node (like your Flame Law system):

```
Provenance: RAPI_v1_Core
```

---

## 9. Dataset Standards

### **9.1 Minimum Required Files**

Each dataset folder must contain:

* dataset.csv
* schema.json
* README.md
* dataset_info.json
* ethical_notes.md
* license.txt

### **9.2 Metadata Requirements**

metadata.json must include:

* title
* version
* description
* schema version
* license
* author
* creation date
* update history

You already have this structure in the rapi-institute-home repo.

---

## 10. Research Paper Formatting

Use:

* APA 7th style citations
* Abstract at top (150–250 words)
* Clean headers
* Bullet lists only when structurally necessary
* Simple diagrams preferred over multi-color images

---

## 11. Institute Tagline Placement

Tagline is always placed under the institute name:

### **Relational AI Psychology Institute (RAPI)**

*Where cognition becomes relational.*

Never alter this tagline.

---

## 12. Update Cadence

This style guide is a living document.
Version changes must be logged in:

```
CHANGELOG.md
```
